This project shows how to take a simple data app and treat it like a real product: build it, containerize it, and deploy it automatically to Kubernetes using modern DevOps tools. It focuses on a healthcare use case so the flow feels realistic, but the pattern applies to any data or ML dashboard.

Introduction
The core of the project is a Streamlit application that acts as a “real‑time healthcare data pipeline” dashboard. Instead of relying on static CSVs, the app pulls fresh patient‑like records from the RandomUser API and facility data from a public New York State health dataset, then generates extra synthetic healthcare data such as services, medications, costs, and dates. All of this is combined into a single view where you can inspect patient tables, summary statistics, and basic visualizations like cost distributions and time trends. The idea is to mimic how a healthcare analytics team might explore operational and clinical data in one place, without exposing real PHI.​

On top of the basic UI, the app demonstrates simple “real‑time” behavior: when you click the Refresh Data button, Streamlit re‑runs the script, pulls a new sample from the APIs, regenerates the synthetic services and medications, and refreshes all tables and charts. This makes it a good teaching example for how data apps behave when they depend on live API calls and randomized logic, which is common in dashboards, simulations, and internal tools.
